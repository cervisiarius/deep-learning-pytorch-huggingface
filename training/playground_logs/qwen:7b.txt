PROMPT> James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week. How many pages does he write a year?
PREFIX> He writes each friend
RESPONSE>  3*2=6 pages a week.
That means he writes each of them 6*2=12 pages a month.
And 12*12=144 pages a year.

Therefore, the answer is 144.

PROMPT> James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week. How many pages does he write a year?
PREFIX> He writes each friend 3*2=<<
RESPONSE> 6=6>>6 pages a week.
So he writes each friend 6*52=<<312=312>>312 pages a year.
Since there are two friends, the total number of pages written in a year is:

312 pages/page * 2 friends = 624 pages/year

PROMPT> James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week. How many pages does he write a year?
PREFIX> 
RESPONSE> First, let's determine how many pages James writes each day.

He writes a 3-page letter to 2 friends. This means for every letter, there are 2 recipients and 3 pages of content.

Each day, he sends off two such letters, so that's:
2 letters/day * 3 pages/letter = 6 pages/day

Since he does this twice a week (Tuesday and Thursday), the total number of pages he writes in a week is:
6 pages/day * 2 days/week = 12 pages/week

Now we need to calculate the annual amount. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:

12 pages/week * 52 weeks/year = 624 pages/year

So, James writes a total of 624 pages a year.
