And it takes half that amount of white fiber, which is 1/2\*2=<<1 bolt of white fiber>>.
Therefore, the total number of bolts required to make a robe is 2 + 1 = <<3 bolts>>.

PROMPT> James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week. How many pages does he write a year?
PREFIX> 
RESPONSE> 
To determine how many pages James writes in a year, we need to know how often he writes to each friend and for how many weeks in a year. Let's assume that James writes to Friend A twice a week and to Friend B twice a week as well.

Friend A: 2 x 52 = 104 letters/year
Friend B: 2 x 52 = 104 letters/year

Since each letter is 3 pages long, we can calculate the total number of pages James writes in a year as follows:

For Friend A: 104 letters x 3 pages/letter = 312 pages/year
For Friend B: 104 letters x 3 pages/letter = 312 pages/year

Therefore, James writes approximately 624 pages in a year (312 pages/year x 2 friends).
